# list_serialization

In order to build the project issue the following:

1) mkdir build
2) cmake ..
3) make

serialize_app and deserialize_app are the two processes
used for serialize and deserialize a simple list with
integer numbers. There is client and a server process,
the first one performs the list serialization and the
second one performs the deserialization and returns
back the sum of integers.
